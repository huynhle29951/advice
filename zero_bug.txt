Zero Bugs And Program Faster
--By Kate Thompson

    A wise man learns by the mistakes of others, a fool only by his own.
    Always make sure you update, compile, and test the code before committing.
    This is the golden rule of programming, the straight brick road to perfection: whenever a mistake happens, ask yourself how to avoid that mistake in the future.
    Function calls require thinking. Read the documentation. Double-check to make sure you know what the function is doing.
    Debugging code is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place. Therefore, if you write the code as complexly as possible, you are, by definition, not smart enough to debug it.
    All errors will be within 3 lines of the place you last changed the program.
    Test every line of code. Write a small test, then write the code.
    Every time you change a line of code, double check everywhere related to that line.
    If your code is not perfectly beautiful when you write it, don’t despair. It never will be. Satisfy yourself when it’s good enough, and do better next time.
    It doesn’t matter how good you are at programming. Your code can be improved when people look at it.
    Many people make a mistake: they try to optimize without collecting data.
    Always attack your own ideas the hardest.
    When someone points out a mistake, it’s a chance to grow. People who are honest with you and point out your mistakes are in some ways true friends.
    Good applications are discoverable, meaning they can be used without reading a manual. Good code is discoverable, meaning things are easy to find. When you create a feature, ask yourself, “How will the user discover this feature?”
    If code is discoverable, users will seek greater knowledge of the system. If code is not discoverable, users will copy and paste from examples.
    Ken Thompson: “Good code, there’s one place where you add that feature and it fits; fragile code, you’ve got to touch ten places.”
    Writing code before it needs to be written is poor management. Never do today what can be put off to tomorrow. You may not have to do it.
    If something will be easier to do now than later, do it now.
    Fixing mistakes, instead of starting over from scratch, is the way to learn. The first step to perfection is learning how to recover when you aren’t perfect.
    By making variables immutable, that is unchangeable. “Control of side effect.” When you know that calling a function will have zero side effects, bugs melt away.
    A protected action; if something goes wrong while you are doing the action, it can be reversed. When an action cannot be reversed, it is called a real action.
    Fail fast explained by Jim Shore: “When a problem occurs, the system fails immediately and visibly. Failing fast is a nonintuitive technique; it sounds like it would make your software more fragile, but it actually makes it more robust. Bugs are easier to find and fix, so fewer go into production.
    The most important concept for proving code correctness is the preconditions and post condition. The preconditions says what can be passed in to a function, and the post conditions describes the state after the function is complete.
    An invariant is always true.
    “Show me your interface and I won’t need your code because it’ll be redundant and irrelevant,” says Guy Steele.
    The lazy method list all edge cases, exceptions, side effects, and errors.
    The key observation of the top down side is that it’s helpful to know what you’re building before you build it. The key observation of the bottom up side is you need to know what tools you have before you can design it.
    Sometimes in your life you will be called on to judge code. When that happens, these three criteria will help you. Functionality, readability, and flexibility.
    One of the best ways to improve your programming is to look at examples of code written by others.
